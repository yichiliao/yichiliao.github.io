There are 10 sets of 10 computer scientists. 9 sets of them are weight exactly the same, and you already know how much weight they should be. However, in the last set of computer scientests, each of them are 1 kg off (you have no idea they are either 1 kg ligher or 1 kg heavier), making the entire set of computer scientists 10 kg lighter or heavier than the other sets. 

There's an extremely accurate digital scale that you are allowed to use only once. How do you determine which set of 10 computer scientists is the fault one?

Difficulties Level: EASY.
