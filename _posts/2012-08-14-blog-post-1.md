There are 12 computer scientists, 11 of them have the exact same weight. However, the last one is either heavier or lighter than others (but you don't know which is the case). 

Your job is to identify the one with unusual weight. The only tool is a seesaw, which unfortunately can only be used 3 times. 

Please find out how to finish your job in these conditions. How do you use the seesaw?

If you need hint, please come to Room B235.

If you solve the puzzle, there's a small present waiting for you at B235 as well.

Aren't headings cool?
