Hint #1:
Think about the base case, which means, if you can only the seesaw once, under what conditions (how many candidates, etc) can you identify the one with different weight.


Hint #2:
There are at least 2 ACTUAL solutions, which don't involve using seesaw to beat anyone nor prototyping a digital weight scale.
