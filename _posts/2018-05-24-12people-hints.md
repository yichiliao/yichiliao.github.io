Please highlight to check the hints.

Hint #1:\\
<span style="color:white">There are at least 2 ACTUAL solutions, which don't involve beating someone with the seesaw nor prototyping a digital weight scale nor asking the 12 computer scientists to brainstorm with you.</span>

\\
Hint #2:\\
<span style="color:white">Think about the base case, which means, if you can only use the seesaw once, under what conditions (how many candidates, etc) can you identify the one with different weight.</span>

\\
Hint #3:\\
<span style="color:white">The first step should be dividing 12 computer scientists into 3 groups of 4 people.</span>
