### Hello, my name is Yi-Chi Liao, I'm a research assistant at National Taiwan University with [Prof. Bing-Yu Chen](https://www.cmlab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~robin/) and [Prof. Liwei Chan](http://people.cs.nctu.edu.tw/~liweichan/). In my master's education, I explored the blend of humans and computers using haptic channel. Inspired by [Andy Clark's extended mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Extended_Mind), my ultimate goal is to augment humanity and fuse the boundaries between physical body and digital computing by creating seamless interfaces. As a HCI researcher, I am familiar with user study design, stats analysis, hardware / software prototyping and fabrication. 

###### My creations include [ThirdHand](https://yichiliao.github.io/portfolio/5-thirdhand/) - a wearable robotic arm generates rich force feedback to the users, [EMS Air Guitar](https://yichiliao.github.io/portfolio/4-emsairguitar/) - a muscle-based rhythmic music interface, [EdgeVib](https://yichiliao.github.io/portfolio/3-edgevib/) - using a 2x2 vibrotactile array to transfer alphanumeric characters, and **haptic-augmented touch input**. These works have been presented at top-tier conferences, including UIST and Siggraph Asia.

**EdgeVib: Effective Alphanumeric Character Output Using a Wrist-Worn Tactile Display.** <br>

<small>
"How to transfer rich spatialtemporal tactile messages while retaining the recognition rates?" has been an important research problem in the development of tactile displays. We present EdgeVib, a set of multistroke alphanumeric patterns based on EdgeWrite. Learning these patterns takes comparable period to Graffiti (15min), while the recognition rates achive 85.9% and 88.6% for alphabet and digits respectively. I am the leading author of this project, contributing the main idea, hardware prototyping, study interface implementation, user study design, stats analysis, paper writing and organizing the research team.

**ThirdHand: Wearing a Robotic Arm to Experience Rich Force Feedback.**<br>

ThirdHnad is a wearable robotic arm provides 5-DOF force feedback to enrich the mobile gaming experience. Comparing to traditional mounted-on-environment force-feedback devices such as phantom, ThirdHand provides higher mobility due to its wearable form. Also, comparing to the muscle-propelled and gyro-effect solutions, our approach enables more accurate control with stronger forces. As a leading author, I generated the idea, hardware / software prototyping and paper writing.

Other Professional Activities

<small>
During 2014 to 2016, I've been a teaching assistant of **Introduction to HCI** (lectured by [Prof. Rong-Hao Liang](http://www.cmlab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~howieliang/) and [Prof. Bing-Yu Chen](https://www.cmlab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~robin/)), and **Computer Architecture** (lectured by [Prof. Bing-Yu Chen](https://www.cmlab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~robin/)) in National Taiwan University.

<small>
I also student volunteered at **Siggraph Aisa 2016**, and held the biggest HCI workshop in Taiwan, **[OpenHCI'15](http://www.openhci.com/2015/index.html)** and **[OpenHCI'16](http://www.openhci.com/2016/index.html)**. Recently, I founded and organized the other workshop, **[HoCuIn'17](https://hocuin2017.wordpress.com/)**, to introduce more research-oriented HCI to gruaduate students in Taiwan.
