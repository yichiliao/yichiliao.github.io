Hi, I'm a Ph.D. student working on Computational Interaction in the [User Interfaces](http://userinterfaces.aalto.fi/) at Aalto University led by [Professor Antti Oulasvirta](http://users.comnet.aalto.fi/oulasvir/). Before that, I received my bachelor's and master's degree at National Taiwan University. My killsets include 3D prototyping, reinforcement learning, and black-box optimization algorithms (especially Bayesian Optimization). As a believer of computational HCI, I am keen on building future touch and haptic interfaces via modeling, controlling, optimization, simulation, and machine-learning.
</small>

<small>
I am currently working on **modelling human's hand manipulation with physical objects using reinforcement-learning-based models** and **assisting design by multi-objective Bayesian Optimization**. My previous topics include touch interaction ([Button design and simulation](), [Dwell+](https://yichiliao.github.io/portfolio/1-dwell+/)), haptic interfaces ([EdgeVib](https://yichiliao.github.io/portfolio/3-edgevib/), [ThirdHand](https://yichiliao.github.io/portfolio/5-thirdhand/)), and AR/VR ([Outside-In](https://yichiliao.github.io/portfolio/2-outsidein/)). All these publications have been presented at CHI, UIST, or Siggraph Asia E-Tech. You can find all my previous works on my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ddny4V4AAAAJ&hl=en).

**Button Simulation and Design via FDVV Models** *[CHI'20, 10-page Paper]*<br>

<small>
Designing a push-button with desired sensation and performance is challenging because the mechanical construction must have the right response characteristics. Physical simulation of a button's force-displacement (FD) response has been studied to facilitate prototyping; however, the simulations' scope and realism have been limited. In this paper, we extend FD modeling to include vibration (V) and velocity-dependence characteristics (V). The resulting FDVV models better capture tactility characteristics of buttons, including snap. They increase the range of simulated buttons and the perceived realism relative to FD models. The paper also demonstrates methods for obtaining these models, editing them, and simulating accordingly. This end-to-end approach enables the analysis, prototyping, and optimization of buttons, and supports exploring designs that would be hard to implement mechanically.

**Dwell+: Multi-Level Mode Selection Using Vibrotactile Cues** *[UIST'17, 10-page Paper]*<br>

<small>
This paper presents Dwell+, a method that boosts the effectiveness of typical dwell select by augmenting the passive dwell duration with active haptic ticks which promptly drives rapid switches of modes forward through the user's skin sensation. Dwell+ enables multi-level dwell select using rapid haptic ticks. To select a mode from a button, users dwell-touch the button until the mode of selection being haptically prompted. Applications demonstrated implementing Dwell+ across different interfaces; ranging from vibration-enabled touchscreens to non-vibrating interfaces.

**Outside-In: Visualizing Out-of-Sight Region-of-Interests in a 360 Video Using Spatial Picture-in-Picture Previews** <br>*[UIST'17, 9-page Paper]*<br>

<small>
We propose Outside-In, a visualization technique which re-introduces off-screen ROIs into the main screen as spatialpicture-in-picture (PIP) previews. The geometry of the pre-view windows further encodes the ROIs’ relative directions tothe main screen view, allowing for effective navigation.

<small>
"Transferring rich spatialtemporal tactile messages while retaining the recognition rates" has been a major challenge in the development of tactile displays. We present EdgeVib, a set of multistroke alphanumeric patterns based on EdgeWrite. Learning these patterns takes comparable period to learning Graffiti (15min), while the recognition rates achive 85.9% and 88.6% for alphabet and digits respectively.

<small>
ThirdHnad is a wearable robotic arm provides 5-DOF force feedback to enrich the mobile gaming experience. Comparing to traditional mounted-on-environment force-feedback devices such as phantom, ThirdHand provides higher mobility due to its wearable form. Also, comparing to the muscle-propelled and gyro-effect solutions, our approach enables more accurate control with stronger forces.
