After taking an excellent 3-hr lecture given by [Prof. Scott MacKenzie](http://www.yorku.ca/mack/) about [empirical research methods used in HCI](http://www.yorku.ca/mack/HCIbook/)), I've always wanted to introduce the topic to the students in NTU.

In this 3-hr talk, I provided empirical methods and materials based on the Prof. MacKenzie's lecture, and I added a few practical examples from my research experiences.
