Invited by Prof. Liwei Chan, I was glad to share some basic knowledge about haptics at the Future Interface Design course of National Chiao-Tung University.

There five parts compose of the whole 2-hr talk; including: human haptics, social / emotional touch, haptic illusions, haptic UI and trend of haptic technology.

Besides lecturing, I also prepared a few hands-on experiments for the students to measure tactile sensativity, understand haptic communication and experience haptic illusions by themselves.
