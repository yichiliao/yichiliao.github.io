<small>This paper presents EdgeVib, a system of spatiotemporal vibration patterns for delivering alphanumeric characters on wrist-worn vibrotactile displays. </small>

<small>We first investigated spatiotemporal pattern delivery through a watch-back tactile display by performing a series of user studies. The results reveal that employing a 2×2 vibrotactile array is more effective than employing a 3×3 one, because the lower-resolution array creates clearer tactile sensations in less time consumption. </small>

<small>**The first study compares the accuracis of recognizing straight lines on (a) a 3x3 layout and (b) a 2x2 layout. (c) The hardward design of these two layout.**</small> 

<small>We then deployed EdgeWrite patterns on a 2×2 vibrotactile array to determine any difficulties of delivering alphanumerical characters, and then modified the unistroke patterns into multistroke EdgeVib ones on the basis of the findings. <small>

<small>**Examples of EdgeVib. (a) The letter “k”: two 3-vibration patterns; and (b) the letter “b”: a combination of a 3-vibration and a 2- vibration patterns. (c) The delimiter was a short (200ms) vibration at the bottom-right corner.**</small> 

<small>The results of a 24-participant user study reveal that the recognition rates of the modified multistroke patterns were significantly higher than the original unistroke ones in both alphabet (85.9% vs. 70.7%) and digits (88.6% vs. 78.5%) delivery, and a further study indicated that the techniques can be generalized to deliver two-character compound messages with recognition rates higher than 83.3%. The guidelines derived from our study can be used for designing watch-back tactile displays for alphanumeric character output.</small>
