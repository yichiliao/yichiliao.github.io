<small>This paper presents fStrip, a wearable device, which enables the use of tangible-and-deformable interface on-demand for mobile tasks. fStrip consists of an array of strain gauges for shape reconstruction, a 9 degrees-of-freedom inertial motion unit (IMU) for motion input, and an optional strip display for visual output. We present the prototype and an algorithm for shape reconstruction based on NURBS approximation. Our experiment reported that, from a set of six primitives collected from 9 participants, fStrip achieved 88% recognition rate using SVM classifier.</small>
